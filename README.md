Space Simulator
===============
The Space Simulator Java application. It simulates the motion (and rotation) of the planets
and spacecraft(s).

The planets are moving based on Keplerian law (simplified elliptical) trajectory.

The position and velocity of spacecraft(s) are computed based on Newtonian gravitational law. The gravitation of all the planets
influences the trajectory of the spacecrafts.

Features
========
* Headless computations
